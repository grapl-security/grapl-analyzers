# grapl-analyzers
A repository for some Analyzers built to be used with [Grapl](https://github.com/insanitybit/grapl).

Uses the [grapl-analyzer-deployer](https://github.com/insanitybit/grapl-analyzer-deployer) for automatic deployment.

Some of these analyzers rely on external Grapl plugins.

These analyzers are *examples*, and you should perform your own validation before deploying to a production environment.
